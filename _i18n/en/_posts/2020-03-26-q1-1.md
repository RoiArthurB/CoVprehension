By definition, a model is a (sometimes extreme) simplification of reality. Besides, each model is built with a particular objective in mind.

For each of the models, some simplifications had to be made. Therefore, some processes (for example, social distancing is a process which is introduced in the models of question 1 but does not appear in the models of question 2) and parameters (for example, the incubation time and the contagious rate are parameters) had to be left out.

When building models that have many processes and parameters, it becomes harder to understand their behaviour, robustness, or the results they produce. Therefore we start with simplified models, then progressively add new parameters and  processes.

These are caveats we have to take into account when studying this epidemic in order to better understand it.

The models developed in response to questions 1 to 3 are examples of such models. They are the building blocks that will allow us  to respond to future questions more comprehensively.
