Many of us around the world are wondering about the current outbreak of COVID-19 and, in particular, what individual and collective measures should be implemented to limit the spread of the virus. 

This interactive website has been created by a team of [researchers](/about) from different disciplines, all specialists in complex systems modelling and willing to mobilize their skills to answer these legitimate questions. 

- Understand (the spread of the virus, the actions taken)
- Objectivate (give a more concrete form to this event that is beyond us)
- Visualize (show the mechanisms at work)
- Identify (essential principles and actions to be implemented)
- Overcoming (fears and anxieties to become actors in the epidemic)

Our M.O. is modeling. For each answer asked, we will try to answer with one or more models, in the spirit of the answers already formulated on the site. 

Reflecting, learning, debating, experimenting by oneself, these are good ways to fight this epidemic which is beyond us all but of which we are nevert
