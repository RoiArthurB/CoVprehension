Welcome to our simulator page!

Here you are able to run, by yourself, some of the simulation models used to feed the website, in particular questions 1 to 3.

Instructions:

- Choose your simulation in the drop-down menu
- Click "Initialise"
- Click "Simulate"  

All you have to do now is watch the simulation run. Run it as many times as you like.

Enjoy!
