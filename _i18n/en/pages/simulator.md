Welcome to our simulator page!

Here you are able to run, by yourself, some of the simulation models used to feed the website, in particular questions 1 to 3.

Instructions:

- Choose your simulation in the drop-down menu
- Click on the "Initialize" button
- Click on the "Simulate" button 

All you have to do now is watch the simulation run and run it as many times as you like.

Enjoy!
